# Windows Lab VM Update-Stomp
This is an effort to kill Windows Update in a lab environment where updates cause problems with the activities.
As a bonus are various cosmetic changes (hiding the Search bar, disables News and Weather, etc.) that I like having on Windows machines I use.

### Why?
Windows Updates are incredibly persistent; somehow they're never installed on my users' computers, but they force-run on BHIS's SOC Core Lab VM...

### Details
The script should be thoroughly commented and clearly written, but let me know if I need to clarify something.

For more details and context, please check out the original post on my site: [MaxwellCTI: BHIS SOCC Lab Config](https://maxwellcti.com/bhis-antisyphon-and-webinars/black-hills-soc-core/labs/00-bhis-socc-lab-config/)
