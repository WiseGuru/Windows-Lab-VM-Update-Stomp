# Windows Lab VM Update-Stomp
This is an effort to kill Windows Update in a lab environment where updates cause problems with the activities.
As a bonus are various cosmetic changes (hiding the Search bar, disables News and Weather, etc.) that I like having on Windows machines I use.

This script will:
1. *Kill* any active update process
2. *Disable* all update services
3. *Create a task* that kills processes and disables update services to run at login and then every 15 minutes (you are welcome to adjust this lower, but I didn't find it necessary)
4. *Disable Antimalware Realtime Monitoring* (which is required by at least one lab)
5. *Clean up the interface* (disable Cortana, hide News and Interests, hide the Search bar because you can just open the start menu and type to search, and show full file extensions.) and *restart Explorer* to make the changes take effect.

## Run the script now
To run the script *right now in your VM*, copy and paste the command below into an elevated (e.g. Admin) PowerShell session.
```PowerShell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiseGuru/Windows-Lab-VM-Update-Stomp/main/KillWindowsUpdates.ps1 -outfile .\KWU.ps1 | .\KWU.ps1
```

This downloads the `KillWindowsUpdate.ps1` file, saves it as `KWU.ps1`, and then runs the script.

## Kill updates and install SPICE/VirtIO drivers (Linux)
Because you won't by able to copy/paste, I've shortened the URL to get to `KWU_WGET_Command.ps1`.

From within the VM, open Edge, navigate to this URL, and copy and paste the script into an Elevated PowerShell session and follow the prompts.

## Manual Instructions
You can also do this more manually by running Powershell as an administrator and copy/pasting the code from [KillWindowsUpdates.ps1](https://github.com/WiseGuru/Windows-Lab-VM-Update-Stomp/blob/main/KillWindowsUpdates.ps1) into the terminal.

The script is thoroughly commented and clearly written to help you learn about PowerShell, but let me know if I should clarify something.

After you've run the script, you can run the following command to get the status of the update services that should be stopped.

```PowerShell
Get-Service -Name wuauserv,bits,UsoSvc,InstallService
```

# Why?
Windows Updates are incredibly persistent; somehow they're never installed on my users' computers, but they force-run on BHIS's SOC Core Lab VM...
